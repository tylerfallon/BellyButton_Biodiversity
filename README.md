# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

The purpose of this web app is to create a visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer on a comprehensive dashboard. The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard will be completed by creating a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart of the data using Javascript, Plotly, D3.js, HTML, and Bootstrap.
